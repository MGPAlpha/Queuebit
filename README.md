Changes from pitched demo version:

Abandonment of DOTS / ECS networking: the code for it is too new and there are no tutorials online (the latest 2019.3.0f6 update broke netcode 0.0.4).

I'm now using the old HLAPI networking code as there are plenty of tutorials out there on it, and for a LAN multiplayer game it should be good enough.
